The psychology of opinions

The dataset for this question is extracted from English Twitter. <a href="https://quera.org/contest/assignments/45363/problems/157863">dataset source</a> For each comment, 10 psychological features including sense', 'honor', 'curse', 'despise', 'situation', 'antihuman', 'roughness', 'slaughter', 'strike_support', 'depression_rate' are considered. . Each of these 10 features has been given a score between 0 and 4 so that the level of stress and damage of each person can be checked.

Using the training data set, we developed a model that gives each comment a score from 0 to 4 in each psychological characteristic. The output of the problem is not just a number!, but for each text in the test data set, 10 values should be predicted for each of the attributes.
